# C^2IBKE: Collaborative Contrastive Learning via Information Bottleneck for Knowledge Graph Embedding

# Datasets
- Our model use the FB15k-237, WN18RR, Kinship, and UMLS datasets for Knowledge graph link prediction.
- The datasets mentioned above are included in the data directory.

#  Requirements
- python==3.9
- torch==1.4.0
- ordered_set==3.1
- pillow=9.4.0
- numpy==1.25.0
- torch_scatter==2.0.4
- scikit_learn==0.21.1

#  Running
Start the run.py to train C^2IBKE and the corresponding ranks for link prediction tasks.
